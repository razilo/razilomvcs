* Lots of things!

This is WIP so we need to take it with some pinches of salt. We shoudl use knex for DB access, log4js for logging issues and exceptions. We should build our app in src, we should  import to node modules folder (in the container, not locally) and we should put extra class stuff that is not connected to app, generic stuff in the Library folder. Apart from that, it pretty much resmbles slim and MVC design patterns.

1. Get log4js working

2. Get model base class working, using knex (not so important as we can do 80% of project without any db access at all, its a proxy!)

3. Get middle ware working, demonstrating the varied layers of MW

4. ...
